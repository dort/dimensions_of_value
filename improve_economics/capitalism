Downsides:

  Promotion of greed as an attribute to be valued

  View of environment as a collection of resources to be plundered.
  Also, tendency to dump pollution back into it.

  Exploitation of labor.

  Exploitation of customers: markets are not ideal, and monopolies sometimes exist.
  Unfair competitive practices can drive rivals out.



Upsides:

  Efficiency with regard to distribution of resources.

  Provides powerful economic engine.
  Sparks innovation.
  Raises standard of living (for at least some if not all).

i feel the goal must be to create a system of rewarding those who create 'ecological credit'
such as:
   teachers
   musicians and other artists
   holistic gardeners and farmers
   researchers who embrace non-linearity and eschew reductionist thinking
   etc...

capitalists, employers, corporations should be limited, especially with regard to the environmental damage they do, but
also in terms of how they are allowed to plow money back into the system and corruptly amass power, perpetuating
their own wealth -- taxing the extremely wealthy heavily would seem to me to be necessary -- despite these measures,
the goal should not be to hamstring those who do want to pursue wealth, but rather to treat them with ambivalence -- as
opposed to the way we should hold those who create ecological credit in high regard
