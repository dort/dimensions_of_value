Markets are presumed to be the most efficient way to distribute resources. Ecological and Biological systems however, often benefit from inefficiency, and perhaps we humans could learn from these patterns. The 'waste products' of one organism are the food of others, creating a situation where optimization is rarely pursued as an ultimate goal in itself. Meanwhile human societies and economies seek and consume energy to a degree that is quite 'unnatural'. It seems obvious that our quest for efficiency is misguided. Were we to embrace a different strategy to be more 'organic' in our consumption and use of resources such that the waste we generate could be less toxic and more 'efficiently' integrated into other natural systems, our presence on the planet would potentially be far less disruptive.
