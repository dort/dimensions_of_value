One of Stephen Harrod Buhner's central theses is that feeling is distinct from thinking, knowing or believing.

With that 'fact' held foremost, it appears that the best way to proceed is to attempt to feel my way through an understanding and vision of the bottom up "planetary economic systems that lead
to true sharing, fairness, and compassion" (in the wise distillation of Edbo)/

Honoring all humans (and all life, as well as everything "else" too) as compassionate, feeling, sharing, fair beings is perhaps a start.

Reductionist thinking and education isn't so much wrong as it is incomplete.

Disassociated mentation and an overemphasis on the rational, logical, and linear won't get us to where we want to be.
