global advocacy for the planet

i personally see capitalism as problematic -- related to that i also think that our human concept of "ownership" is also suboptimal

but incremental change is much more likely to succeed vs. a more wholesale endeavor -- so my thought is that we could substantially alter our behavior and treatment of our environment(s) without attempting (certainly not at first) to too radically alter the current paradigms

so rather than taking capitalism/ownership on fully, maybe we can concentrate on a specific smaller task related to those larger issues and attempt to deal with the most problematic (in my view at least) aspect(s) where gains could be made

as i see it, Ownership of Natural Resources is one of the huge structural problems, so trying to tackle this directly is my idea

rather than using national governments as tools/levers, my thought is to have the primary impetus provided by a network of individuals from around the globe that is intentionally 'grown" from the bottom up, ratther than being built upon principles of centralization and direction from the top

i realize, that even as i've attempted to limit the scope of this "swarm"'s goals, it's still going to be an enormous challenge to make the changes i envision

the two biggest problems as i see them are:

   1. vested interests
        mining companies/rights
	industries of all sorts
           lumber
   	   energy
	any company (or other entity) which pollutes
   2. lifestyles (mainly in the "developed world" currently) which result in overconsumption and waste

there are almost certainly going to be other impediments that stand in the way of the change i want

and admittedly there is more that could and should be done, with regard for instance to animal (or more broadly "biological"?) rights -- especially as "factory farming," the destruction of ecosystems, extinction of species and on so many other fronts like concentration of capital in the hands of a few who exploit the poor, but i do think it makes sense to concentrate and focus on a subset of humanity's "problems" rather than trying to wholesale overturn/undo all that is wrong immediately -- though if others concentrate on different issues which are outside of the gaftp purview, we can still ally ourselves with those efforts as i think that might expand the "power" and reach of all of us trying to stem the tide of waste, exploitation, inequality and the plundering/destruction of invaluable systems that span the gamut from the "natural" to the societal and cultural domains
